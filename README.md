# Calculator
A Tkinter Python Calculator
Python with Tkinter outputs the fastest and easiest way to create a GUI applications, Such as calculators. Which we will cover today in this presentation.
Python has a lot of GUI frameworks, butÂ Tkinter is the only framework that's built into the Python standard library.

These are the steps to make a Simple Gui Calculator using Tkinter:

1) Import everything from tkinter Module 
 import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import *

2) Create a GUI window (tk.Tk()) as well as its geometry,size,title and background color.

3) Add a widget so we can input the numbers and operators into it, we modify its size, background color, pading and width

4) Start by making functions for the buttons(Numbers,Operators..)

5) Make a If statement that covers every possible Result.

6) Then we give the buttons their design and place(modifying size, bgcolor, pading...)

7) Finally, we start the GUI with this command (calc.mainloop()) 

"calc" in calc.mainloop is the name of the GUI i just chose to give the last its name.
